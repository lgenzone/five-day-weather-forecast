# Five Day Forecast 

## Description 

The Five Day Forecats app was designed as a travel tool. The user can look up a city to see the weather forecast for that day and the next five days. The app not only displays the temperature in that city, but also the humidity and wind speed, allowing users to plan accordingly.

This app retrieves weather data for cities using a third-party API (openweathermap.org). This project taught me more about working with third-party APIs and how to make requests with specific parameters to a URL.
